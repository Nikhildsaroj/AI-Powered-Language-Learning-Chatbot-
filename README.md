AI-Powered Language Learning Chatbot 
By Nikhil Saroj
1. Introduction
The AI-powered language learning chatbot is designed to assist users in learning new languages through interactive conversations. By leveraging the Google Gemini API and AI-driven feedback, the chatbot provides personalized guidance, corrects mistakes, and enhances the learning experience. The system is structured to handle user input, process responses, and deliver corrections in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, the chatbot has been developed as a Flask web application with an interactive UI to create a real-life AI chatbot experience.
2. System Architecture
The chatbot system follows a modular architecture consisting of:
•	User Input Handling: Captures user preferences (learning language, native language, proficiency level) and processes chat inputs.
•	AI Response Generation: Uses Google Generative AI (Gemini API) to generate meaningful conversations in the target language.
•	Speech Synthesis: Converts chatbot responses into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for an immersive experience.
•	Mistake Analysis & Correction: Identifies language errors and provides corrections stored in an SQLite database.
•	Feedback System: Reviews past mistakes and generates personalized learning feedback to help users improve.
•	AI Wrapper Libraries: Incorporates LangChain to manage LLM interactions efficiently, enhancing system modularity and scalability.
•	Flask Web Application: Provides an interactive UI that allows users to communicate with the chatbot in real time.
3. Technologies Used
•	Backend: Python with Flask
•	AI Processing: Google Generative AI (Gemini API) for language model interactions
•	Speech Synthesis: Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)
•	Translation: Deep Translator for real-time translations
•	Database: SQLite for storing and analyzing user mistakes
•	AI Management: LangChain for efficient LLM-based responses and retrieval
•	Frontend UI: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery


4. Key Features
4.1 Conversational Chatbot
•	Asks the user about their language learning preferences.
•	Engages in meaningful dialogue in the target language.
•	Provides interactive learning through structured conversations.
4.2 Speech Output
•	Uses gTTS to convert responses into speech.
•	Supports adjustable speech speed (normal/slow).
•	Enhances interactivity by providing voice-based responses.
4.3 Mistake Analysis & Correction
•	Uses AI to analyze grammar and vocabulary mistakes.
•	Stores mistakes and corrections in SQLite for future reference.
•	Utilizes retrieval techniques to ensure mistake tracking is accurate and useful.
4.4 Personalized Feedback System
•	Generates a summary of the user’s mistakes.
•	Provides categorized feedback with grammar explanations and learning resources.
•	Reviews focus areas for improvement and suggests structured exercises.
4.5 Flask Web Application with Interactive UI
•	A fully functional chatbot interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	Users can input messages, receive responses, and interact through a real-life chatbot UI.
•	Supports buttons for checking mistakes, receiving feedback, and speech output.
5. Workflow
1.	User initiates a conversation by selecting a learning language and proficiency level.
2.	Chatbot generates responses using Google Generative AI (Gemini API) and provides real-time speech output.
3.	User mistakes are analyzed, and corrections are stored in SQLite.
4.	Personalized feedback is generated based on previous mistakes, offering structured learning guidance.
5.	User reviews corrections and practices improved language usage.
6.	The UI allows for seamless interaction between the user and the chatbot.




6. Database Structure
The chatbot maintains a database (mistakes.db) with the following table:
 
. Future Enhancements
•	Multilingual Support: Expand to more languages and dialects.
•	Advanced Speech Recognition: Improve speech-to-text accuracy.
			
			
•	Gamification: Introduce achievements and rewards for consistent learning.
•	Integration with Learning Apps: Sync progress with language-learning platforms.
•	Voice-based Conversation Handling: Allow users to interact via voice commands for a hands-free learning experience.
•	Improved UI Design: Enhance chatbot interface with better animations and visual appeal.
8. Conclusion
The AI-powered chatbot is an innovative approach to language learning, integrating LLMs, speech synthesis, and mistake analysis for a dynamic experience. By providing corrections and personalized feedback, it ensures learners continuously improve their skills in a structured way. The integration of Flask with an interactive UI makes the chatbot more engaging and provides a real-life conversational experience. Future enhancements will further elevate its effectiveness and user engagement.
